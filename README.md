# 🦊 ShadowFox Internship Project – Advanced ML & NLP Tasks

This repository contains my completed internship tasks for **ShadowFox**, focusing on Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The project demonstrates implementation, analysis, visualization, and evaluation of models as per the given task guidelines.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Implement and analyze machine learning and language models
- Explore model behavior on different input scenarios
- Visualize performance and compare with baseline models
- Draw meaningful insights and conclusions
- Follow ethical and best practices in ML/NLP

## 🧠 Task Breakdown (Mapped to 7 Steps)

### ✅ Step 1: Problem Statement
Implemented ML and NLP-based solutions to analyze model performance and behavior.

---

### ✅ Step 2: LM Selection
A **simulated Language Model evaluation framework** was used to analyze:
- Simple Q&A
- Context-based prompts
- Creative writing
- Technical explanation prompts

---

### ✅ Step 3: Exploration & Analysis
The Language Model was evaluated on multiple prompt types and scored against a baseline model using predefined metrics.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Research Questions & Objectives
- How does the LM perform compared to a baseline?
- Which prompt type yields the best results?
- How strong is the contextual understanding of the model?

---

### ✅ Step 5: Visualization of Results
Visualization techniques used:
- **Bar Chart** – LM vs Baseline comparison
- **Line Chart** – Performance trend of the Language Model

---

### ✅ Step 6: Project Alignment & Evaluation
The project aligns with:
- NLP & ML best practices
- Ethical AI usage
- Clear evaluation and interpretation

---

### ✅ Step 7: Conclusion & Insights
- The Language Model consistently outperforms the baseline
- Best performance observed in **Technical Explanation prompts**
- Strong contextual understanding shown in context-based prompts

---

## 🧪 Language Model Evaluation Code

The LM evaluation includes:
- Data creation using Pandas
- Visualization using Matplotlib
- Textual interpretation of results

Run the file using:
```bash
python lm_evaluation.py

Sample Output
